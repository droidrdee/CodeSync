# Getting Started with codesync

Welcome to codesync, your intelligent companion for storing and sharing codegen prompts and conversations in VS Code or Cursor!

## Usage

### 1. Drag Codesync Panel to Right Side

We recommend dragging the codesync panel to the right side of your screen, in the same group as Cursor's side panel.

No work on your end. There might be some delay! 

### 3. codesync blame: Viewing Saved Chats

Hover over AI-generated code to see the prompt that led to that particular code snippet.

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: When you first start codesync, the extension will read the chats in your history and attempt to match 
them to files. View chats that have "matched" pieces of code in the STAGED CHATS section. 

### 4. highlight mode: Toggle using Command-Shift-G

See all the code in a file that has been AI-generated. Colors correspond to one message.

```

```

### 6. Continuing a Chat

1. Select a previous chat from the Panel View.
2. Click the "resume" button to continue the chat.
3. Codesync will provide all necessary context, including prompts and context files, in a markdown file.
